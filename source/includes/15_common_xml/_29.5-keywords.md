[`<devicedata>`][1]


This element is used to determine whether or not a driver is returned in a standard driver search from the online driver database. For example, passing `Lua_Agent` would treat this driver as an Agent and not return it in a standard driver search


### Example

```xml
 <keywords>Lua_Agent</keywords>
```
