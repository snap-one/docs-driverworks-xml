The sort order element is used to assign order to commands. This order refelects the manner in which the commands are displayed in Composer Proâ€™s programming area. 

In the example, the sort order element is used to display the command Select Channel 3 in the third spot in a list of channels. 


### Example


```xml
~<command>~
			<name>Select Channel 3</name>
			<description>Select Channel PARAM1</description>
			<sort_order>3</sort_order>
			<params>
				<param>
					<name>Channel</name>
					<type>CUSTOM_SELECT:SelectChannelParamSelectThree</type>
				</param>
			</params>
</command>
```
