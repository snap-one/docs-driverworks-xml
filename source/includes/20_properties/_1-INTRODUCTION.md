# Properties XML

`<properties></properties>`

This area contains definitions for the XML elements that are supported in the Properties section of a device driverâ€™s driver.xml file. Properties are exposed in the Composer Pro System Design interface on the Properties tab. They provide an excellent way for an integrator to configure your driver.

Additional information regarding Properties, including the various types of properties supported, and the role they play in driver performance can be found here: [DriverWorks Fundamentals: Properties][1]
