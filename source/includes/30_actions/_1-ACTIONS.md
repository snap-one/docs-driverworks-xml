# Actions XML

`<actions></actions>`

The Actions XML elements are used to define driver configuration elements that are executable. Youâ€™ll notice many similarities between Actions and Properties. However, Actions differ in that many rely upon corresponding LUA code to accomplish their goal. 




For a list of supported Action types and how they can assist with driver configuration, please see the [Actions][1] section of the DriverWorks Fundamentals Guide.
