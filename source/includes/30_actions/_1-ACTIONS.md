`<actions></actions>`

The Actions XML elements are used to define programming which is specific a driverâ€™s initial installation and configuration. Typically, the functionality provided through Actions is one-time setup configuration and not required for ongoing driver use.

For a list of supported Action types and how they can assist with driver configuration, please see the [Actions][1] section of the DriverWorks Fundamentals Guide.
