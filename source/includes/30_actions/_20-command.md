## command

`<command></command>`


### Parent

[`<action>`][1]


The command element contains the name of the function that has been written in the driverâ€™s LUA code that supports the use of the Action. In the example, the Add and Connect Relays Action, relies upon a function written by the driver writer called AddRelays. When an integrator executes the Add and Connect Relays Action, it calls the AddRelays function.

Without the inclusion of a corresponding LUA function, an Action will not function.


### Example

```xml
<actions>
			<action>
				<name>Add and Connect Relays</name>
				<command>AddRelays</command>
				<params>
					<param>
						<name>Outlet</name>
					<type>CUSTOM_SELECT:GetPropertiesForAction</type>
					</param>
				</params>
			</action>
</actions>
```
