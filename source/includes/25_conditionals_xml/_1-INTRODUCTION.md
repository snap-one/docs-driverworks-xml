# Conditionals XML

`<conditionals></conditionals>`

This area contains definitions for the XML elements that are supported in the Conditionals section of a device driver’s driver.xml file. Conditionals are defined in the driver’s XML area within the conditionals tag. 

Driver conditionals are useful as they provide the opportunity for custom programming through the interface found in Composer Pro. When considering conditionals, it’s helpful to think of them as “If” programming statements. For example, a light driver may have a simple conditional defined for when the light is in the On state. Using this conditional can then support programming in the project that will be executed if the light is On.

Additional information regarding the types of Conditionals supported as well as how those Conditionals can be used in driver programming can be found here: [DriverWorks Fundamentals: Conditionals][1]
