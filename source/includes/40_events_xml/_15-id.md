## id

`<id></id>`


### Parent

[`<event>`][1]


The id element provides a way to assign a numerical identification value to an individual Event.  All Events require an `<id></id>` value. It is recommended that Events be numbered beginning with 0. 

In the example, and Event named “Static Event” is defined under the `<events></events>` XML and has been assigned an Id value of 0.

### Example

```xml
<events>
   <event>
		<id>0</id>
		<name>Static Event</name>
		<description>When the NAME Static Event changes</description>
		<sort_order>1</sort_order>
	</event>
</events>
```
